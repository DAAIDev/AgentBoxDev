# Pipeline Status — Self-Repair Agent Loop

> **Protocol for this file:**
> - **Read first** every time you (Claude, Adam, or Chris) start a session in this repo.
> - **Update** after each meaningful action: commit, blocker hit, decision needed, wedge complete.
> - **Keep it scannable** — three weeks from now this should still be readable in 30 seconds.
> - When a wedge closes, move "Done" items into the cumulative changelog and reset the active sections for the next wedge.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-24 by Chris's Claude (scaffolding merged to main; ADR 0001 decided)
**Current wedge:** 1 — Schema + Triage worker (~1 week)
**ETA:** 2026-06-02

## Wedge 1 — Schema + Triage worker

### Done
- [x] v0.2 architecture spec (Adam) — 2026-05-24
- [x] v0.3.2 build plan (Chris) — 2026-05-24
- [x] Migration SQL drafted — [migrations/001_self_repair_pipeline.sql](./migrations/001_self_repair_pipeline.sql)
- [x] Triage system prompt drafted — [prompts/triage.system.md](./prompts/triage.system.md)
- [x] Collaboration scaffolding committed + merged to main (PR #5, 2026-05-24)
- [x] ADR 0001 decided — GitHub App. Adam proceeds with App creation per Implementation notes in the ADR
- [x] Confirmed `dev` branch exists in both `DAAITeam/CRMBackend` and `DAAITeam/CRMFrontEnd` (unprotected — see Blocked section)
- [x] Migration `001_self_repair_pipeline.sql` applied to `agentbox-db-mcp` (2026-05-24). Verified: 4 new tables present (`mcp_feedback_task_issues`, `agent_runs`, `agent_run_prs`, `agent_run_events`); `mcp_feedback_tasks` has all 14 new columns including `state`, `agent_eligible`, `scope`, `acceptance_md`, `synthesized_bug_md`, `proposed_fix_md`. No legacy rows needed backfill (0 rows had `github_issue_number IS NOT NULL`).

### In progress
- [x] `tools/github.mjs` — `ghSearchCode` + `ghGetFile` + `createGitHubIssue` + tool defs + dispatcher. Smoke-tested live (paths and snippets verified).
- [x] `triage.mjs` — `triageFeedbackTask(taskId, pool)` exported. Full agentic loop, BUG-only short-circuit, plan validation, persist to `mcp_feedback_tasks`, opens 1-2 issues, populates `mcp_feedback_task_issues`. Issue body includes synthesized bug, acceptance criteria, reproducer, proposed fix, pre-written test, cross-link for paired scope.
- [x] `setImmediate(triageFeedbackTask(...))` wiring in `server.js` webhook handler. **Gated by `ENABLE_TRIAGE_WORKER=true` env var** — when false (default), falls through to legacy `pushKanbanTaskToGitHub`. Clean cutover when ready.
- [x] Safety poller — `safetyPollTriage(pool)` exported. `setInterval` in `server.js` (also gated by `ENABLE_TRIAGE_WORKER`). Default tick 60s, configurable via `TRIAGE_POLL_MS`. Resets stuck `running` rows >5min; picks up `pending` rows >1min.
- [~] **End-to-end smoke test** — ran [scripts/wedge1-smoke-test.mjs](./scripts/wedge1-smoke-test.mjs) against live `agentbox-db-mcp`. Code path verified end-to-end up to the Anthropic call: synthetic BUG row inserted, atomic claim worked, `triageFeedbackTask` invoked Sonnet, **failed at the API with `credit balance too low`** (HTTP 400). Error correctly caught + persisted to `planner_error`. Test row cleaned up. Remaining: top up Anthropic account, re-run, watch issues open. The code is good; this is a billing issue.

### Blocked / needs Chris
- [ ] **Configure branch protection** on `main` + `dev` in `DAAITeam/CRMBackend` and `DAAITeam/CRMFrontEnd` before Wedge 2 ships. Both `dev` branches exist but are currently unprotected. Rules: agent App denied write on `main`; agent App can open PRs on `dev` but not push directly.
- [ ] **`dev` branches are stale** (~March 2026 last commit in both repos). Decide before Wedge 2: fast-forward `dev` to `main`, or treat the existing `dev` as an integration branch that diverges intentionally. Adam's agent branches need to be created from a `dev` that mirrors current `main` behavior — otherwise PRs against `dev` won't reflect production reality.
- [ ] **Rotate `GITHUB_TOKEN`** in AgentBoxDev's Cloud Run secrets. Local `.env` token is expired (verified during smoke test of `tools/github.mjs`). Triage worker can't run in production without a valid token. Same token is used by existing `kanban-github-sync.mjs` and `callGitHub` in `server.js` — they're all broken too if this is stale in prod.
- [ ] **Top up Anthropic account / verify API key** — local `.env` `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` returned `400 credit balance too low` during the Wedge 1 smoke test. Either the account on file needs credit or the key needs to point at a funded account. Check Cloud Run secret too; if it's the same key, the chat endpoint at `/chat` will start failing too.

### Next (after Wedge 1 exit gate)
- Open Wedge 2 issue from [WEDGE_ISSUES.md](./WEDGE_ISSUES.md)
- Configure branch protection on `main` + `dev` in both CRM repos
- Start `.github/workflows/agent-implement.yml`

## Wedge 2-4 — not yet active

See [WEDGE_ISSUES.md](./WEDGE_ISSUES.md) for the planned deliverables and exit gates. Don't open these issues until the previous wedge exits.

## Cumulative changelog (compact)
- **2026-05-24** — v0.2 architecture spec written (Adam)
- **2026-05-24** — v0.3 build plan written (Chris)
- **2026-05-24** — v0.3.1 revision: Actions-first runtime (replaces custom GCE VM); wedges collapsed 6 → 4
- **2026-05-26** — Wedge 1 started. Migration SQL + triage prompt drafted. Collaboration scaffolding created (CLAUDE.md, PIPELINE_STATUS, WEDGE_ISSUES, SOP).
- **2026-05-26** — Adam's idea wired in: triage now produces `synthesized_bug_md` (technical restatement) + `proposed_fix_md` (suggested shape). Two new columns added to `001_self_repair_pipeline.sql` (still unapplied). Triage prompt updated with Steps 5 and 8 and updated schema/example. Reviewer's Check 3 will gain a "diff resembles proposed shape?" substep when Wedge 3 lands. Catches the "test passes but fix is wrong-shaped" failure mode.
- **2026-05-26** — Auto-pull hook added at `.claude/settings.json`: both Claudes run `git pull --rebase --autostash` on session start.
- **2026-05-24** — PR #5 (scaffolding) merged to main. ADR 0001 decided: GitHub App. `dev` branches confirmed in both CRM repos (unprotected; staleness flagged for Chris).
- **2026-05-24** — Migration 001 applied to `agentbox-db-mcp`. Adam unblocked to start `tools/github.mjs` + `triage.mjs`.
- **2026-05-24** — **Scope narrowed: v1 = BUG only.** `FEATURE_REQUEST`, `IMPROVEMENT`, `QUESTION` short-circuited at the triage worker (mark `state='canceled'`, `skip_reason='non-bug-v1-out-of-scope'`, no Sonnet call). Defense-in-depth rule added to triage system prompt. Build plan §1 + §3.3 updated. Re-evaluate `IMPROVEMENT` after ~50 BUG runs.
- **2026-05-24** — `tools/github.mjs` written and smoke-tested. Exports `ghSearchCode` + `ghGetFile` + Anthropic tool defs + `runTool` dispatcher. Self-contained (no dependency on `server.js`). Uses `text-match` accept header so search returns actual code snippets, not just paths. Expired-token issue flagged for Cloud Run rotation.
- **2026-05-24** — `triage.mjs` written. Full Sonnet agentic loop with TRIAGE_TOOLS, JSON plan validation, persist to `mcp_feedback_tasks`, opens 1-2 GH issues, populates `mcp_feedback_task_issues`. `safetyPollTriage` exported for the background poller.
- **2026-05-24** — `server.js` wired with `setImmediate(triageFeedbackTask)` + `setInterval(safetyPollTriage)`. Both gated by `ENABLE_TRIAGE_WORKER=true` env var so the legacy single-shot classifier keeps running until we flip the flag in prod.
- **2026-05-24** — Wedge 1 code-complete. Remaining: rotate `GITHUB_TOKEN` in Cloud Run, deploy with `ENABLE_TRIAGE_WORKER=true`, file a dev-tenant test BUG to hit the exit gate.
- **2026-05-24** — Smoke test executed against live DB via Cloud SQL proxy. Code path verified through atomic claim → Sonnet invocation; Anthropic returned HTTP 400 (`credit balance too low`). Error caught + persisted correctly. Test row cleaned up. Added Anthropic billing as the third blocker. Smoke test script committed at [scripts/wedge1-smoke-test.mjs](./scripts/wedge1-smoke-test.mjs) — re-runnable after the API key is funded.
